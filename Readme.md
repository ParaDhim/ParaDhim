# 👋 Hi, I'm Paras Dhiman

I'm a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Biosciences from IIIT Delhi, passionate about **secure software systems**, **machine learning**, and **adversarial AI**. I enjoy building and breaking intelligent systems — from cryptanalysis and cipher implementations to streamlining data pipelines using GenAI.

## 💼 Current Focus:
- **Research @ IIITD**:
  - ML-based cryptanalysis [Dr. Ravi Anand](https://iiitd.ac.in/ravianand)  & covert data transmission in networked environments [Dr. Sambuddho Chakravarty](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sambuddho)
  - **Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Systems**: Researching robustness and vulnerabilities(University of South Carolina) in AI systems under the guidance of [Dr. Amitava Das](https://amitavadas.info/)  
- **Building**: Secure systems, ciphers, tooling & optimization algorithms
